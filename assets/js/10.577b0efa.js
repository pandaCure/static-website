This “slow” system is responsible for complex step-by-step reasoning. It lets us plan future events, engage in arguments, or follow mathematical proofs.\nBecause using the “slow” system is so mentally draining, we tend to default to the “fast” one — even when dealing with intellectual tasks like coding.\nImagine that you’re in the middle of a lot of work, and you want to quickly identify what this function does. Take a quick look at it:\nfunction duplicateSpreadsheet(original) {\nif (original.hasPendingChanges) {\nthrow new Error('You need to save the file before you can duplicate it.');\n}\nlet copy = {\ncreated: Date.now(),\nauthor: original.author,\ncells: original.cells,\nmetadata: original.metadata,\n};\ncopy.metadata.title = 'Copy of ' + original.metadata.title;\nreturn copy;\n}\nYou’ve probably noticed that:\nThis function duplicates a spreadsheet.\nIt throws an error if the original spreadsheet isn’t saved.\nIt prepends “Copy of” to the new spreadsheet’s title.\nWhat you might not have noticed (great job if you did though!) is that this function also accidentally changes the title of the original spreadsheet.\nMissing bugs like this is something that happens to every programmer, every day. But now that you know a bug exists, will you read the code differently? If you’ve been reading code in the “fast” mode, it’s likely you’ll switch to the more laborious “slow” mode to find it.\nIn the “fast” mode, we guess what the code does based on naming, comments, and its overall structure. In the “slow” mode, we retrace what the code does step by step.\nThat’s why having a correct mental model is so important. Simulating a computer in our heads is hard enough — and this effort is wasted with wrong mental models.\nDon’t worry if you can’t find the bug at all. This means you’ll get the most out of this course! Over the next modules, we’ll rebuild our mental model of JavaScript together so that you see this bug plain as day.\nIn the next module, we'll start building mental models for some of the most fundamental JavaScript concepts — values and variables.\nPlease click here to send feedback and complete a short survey about this module.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
